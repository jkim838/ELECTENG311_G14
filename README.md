## Overview

### Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a software which controls the output and display operating condition of linear compressor for refrigerators. 

In operation, the controller software constantly communicates with the master in fixed-size JSON-formatted USART with the current operating condition of the linear compressor. The master system can control operating speed of the compressor by transmitting a fixed-size JSON-formatted text via USART.

Included in this document is an overview on development/testing environment and a complete list of components for the controller software.
